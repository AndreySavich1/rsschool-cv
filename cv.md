*__My name is Andrey, I work as a cook, but I realized that I want to connect my life with IT.__*
I started with independent study, but two months later I learned about the course from the **Rs school** and decided to enroll in it.
### I try not to stand still, I study new material, I want to work in this area and constantly grow as a programmer.
**my skills include:**
* Working with **CSS,HTML**

*__And also I study JavaScript__*

I took Ivan Petrechenko's course __"Web Developer 2021"__ , but the practical part was too little for me!

**I have a specialized secondary education, in the future I plan to finish courses from the RS school**
