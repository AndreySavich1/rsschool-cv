    <p>My name is Andrey, I work as a cook, but I realized that I want to connect my life with IT. I started with independent study, but two months later I learned about the course from the Rs school and decided to enroll in it.</p>
    <h3>I try not to stand still, I study new material, I want to work in this area and constantly grow as a programmer.</h3>
    <h3>my skills include:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Working with <b>CSS,HTML</b> </li>

    </ul>
    <p>And also I study JavaScript</p>
    <p>I took Ivan Petrechenko’s course <b>“Web Developer 2021” </b>, but the practical part was too little for me!</p>
